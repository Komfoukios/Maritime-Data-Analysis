# Maritime Data Analysis

This project analyzes hypothetical maritime voyage data, including travel time and fuel consumption between different ports. The goal is to extract useful insights and visualize fuel consumption patterns across routes.

## Technologies Used
- Python 3
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Google Colab

## Project Highlights
- Created a custom dataset simulating maritime voyages.
- Calculated key metrics like average fuel consumption and trip with maximum fuel usage.
- Visualized fuel consumption per route using bar charts.

## How to Run
- Open the `.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
- Execute each cell to recreate the analysis and graphs.
